  question: 
  dialogue:
  - Are you looking for a weapon? An ax would be nice, but I don't have one. Can
    you use a sword?
  - If so, I will give you a small sword, I was also a novice, Sweider helped me
    a lot.
  - Uh... well, it seems this sword is too old and can no longer be used. I'll fix
    it.
  - But I'm out of firewood to reforge, can you help me get some wood? It's best
    to ask Sweider at first, she has a few.
